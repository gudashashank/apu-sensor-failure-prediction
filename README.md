# apu-sensor-failure-prediction
This project uses sensor data from metro train Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) to detect anomalies and predict potential failures. By applying K-Means clustering and LSTM Autoencoder models, it enables predictive maintenance and minimizes downtime. The system analyzes pressure, temperature, and motor current readings to provide early warnings,.
